## resources
- why start here
    - self-study is most important
    - these resources where used to create this lessons / workshop
    - this lessons / whortshop won't cover everything
- resources:
    - [The Go Tour](https://tour.golang.org/)
    - [The Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/)
    - [The Little Go Book](https://github.com/karlseguin/the-little-go-book/blob/master/en/go.md)
    - [go by example](https://gobyexample.com/)
    - [An Introduction to Programming in Go](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro)
    - [effective go - for deep diving](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)


## idea behind
- I belive human learn best by example
- if possible meaningfull / usefull examples
    - building something just because is possible but has less to none actual value
    - this will reduce motivation and happiness with the final product

### lesson / workshop concept

#### building blocks - concepts, exercises, projects
- we have language concepts
- we have small exercises to get to know concepts
- we have small as meaningfull as possible projects / products

#### how it fits together / how is it organized / logic structure of this workshop
- we can create a graph based on the building blocks (concepts, exercises, projects)
    - concepts and exercises are ordered in clusters of fitting topic
    - they build up to projects
- for each project you will have connected concepts
- for concepts you will have connected exercises

- in order to start and finish a certain project you have to:
    - work through the connected concepts
    - work through the connected exercises
    - implement the project
