## idea behind
- I belive human learn best by example
- if possible meaningfull / usefull examples
    - building something just because is possible but has less to none actual value
    - this will reduce motivation and happiness with the final product

### lesson / workshop concept

#### building blocks - concepts, exercises, projects
- we have language concepts
- we have small exercises to get to know concepts
- we have small as meaningfull as possible projects / products

#### how it fits together / how is it organized / logic structure of this workshop
- we can create a graph based on the building blocks (concepts, exercises, projects)
    - concepts and exercises are ordered in clusters of fitting topic
    - they build up to projects
- for each project you will have connected concepts
- for concepts you will have connected exercises

- in order to start and finish a certain project you have to:
    - work through the connected concepts
    - work through the connected exercises
    - implement the project
